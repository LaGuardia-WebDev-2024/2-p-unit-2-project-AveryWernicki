      <p>
        when exploring the castle, you can either explore yourself, or take a guided tour. when taking a  tour the historical significance of the castle on the hill is explained deeply, and i found to be a valuable asset to the viewing. choosing what tour is up to you, as you can choose a witch themed tour or something more conventional. before going however, i feel inclined to tell you it is a contant uphill, and can be very steep.

         the highlands
      </h1>
      
      the highlands of scotland are not only historical, but comepletly unique. from almost treeless mountains, to nearly constant rain and rolling green hills, its a wonder to behold. <br>
    
      to explore, you can either take a walking holiday with a group, or figure the trails out on your own.
